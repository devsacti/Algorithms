# Problem Solving WarmUp to remind key points

## PS
step1 : Accurate Comprehesion about Problem

step2 : Utilizing and Integrating Algorithms to simulate comprehension

step3 : Implementation

## what is the most tough and important step? - step2
All steps is inevitable and necessary,

when deal with problem in real life by computer, the most hard part is coding the problem from real life as computer language integration.

For example, when we confront to 'sorting number' problem,

when peoples do it, we 'just' find smallest number and next, and next blabla

but when do it with computer, we should,at least, understand and use variable and its type

and furthermore we should teach and guide the computer what is local biggest between two number, and the global biggest among numbers

and how to distinguish.

I think step1 or step3 can be practiced along the real life.

but, step2 does not, so important, unfortunately...

### major Algorithms to be utilized and integrated

bfs,dijstra,dfs

dp

sorting and binarysearch
